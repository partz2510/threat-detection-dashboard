## üîπ Dashboard Overview

The **Threat Detection Dashboard** visualizes log data from multiple sources:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Failed Login Attempts
- Detects repeated failed login attempts from operating system logs.
- Visualization: **Bar Chart**
- Example:

![Failed Login Chart](assets/failed_logins_chart.png)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Firewall Blocks
- Displays blocked connection attempts and reasons (e.g., brute force, multiple failed logins).  
- Visualization: **Pie Chart**
- Example:

![Firewall Pie Chart](assets/firewall_pie.png)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Application Errors
- Tracks authentication timeouts and multiple login attempts in applications.  
- Visualization: **Column Chart**
- Example:

![App Errors](assets/app_errors_chart.png)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Source Correlation
- Correlates events across OS, firewall, and application logs to highlight suspicious IP activity.  
- Visualization: **Line Chart / Table**
- Example:

## üîπ SPL Queries

### Failed Logins
```spl
index=threat_demo sourcetype="operating system" "Failed password"
| rex field=_raw "from\s(?<src_ip>\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)"
| stats count by src_ip
| where count > 2
| rename src_ip as "Attacker IP", count as "Failed Attempts"
Firewall Blocks
spl
Copy code
index=threat_demo sourcetype="network and security" "BLOCK"
| rex field=_raw "(?<src_ip>\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+):\d+\s->"
| stats count by src_ip, REASON
| rename src_ip as "Blocked IP", count as "Block Count"
Application Errors
spl
Copy code
index=threat_demo sourcetype="application" ("Authentication timeout" OR "Multiple login attempts")
| rex field=_raw "from\s(?<src_ip>\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)"
| stats count by src_ip
| rename src_ip as "Source IP", count as "App Error Count"
Multi-Source Correlation (Demo-Compatible)
spl
Copy code
index=threat_demo sourcetype="operating system" "Failed password"
| rex field=_raw "(?<src_ip>\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)"
| eval log_type="OS Failed Login"
| stats count by src_ip log_type
| append [
    search index=threat_demo sourcetype="network and security" "BLOCK"
    | rex field=_raw "(?<src_ip>\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+):\d+\s->"
    | eval log_type="Firewall Block"
    | stats count by src_ip log_type
]
| append [
    search index=threat_demo sourcetype="application" ("Authentication timeout" OR "Multiple login attempts")
    | rex field=_raw "(?<src_ip>\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)"
    | eval log_type="App Error"
    | stats count by src_ip log_type
]
| chart sum(count) over src_ip by log_type
üîπ How to Run the Project
Open Splunk Free Demo ‚Üí Search & Reporting.

Upload the logs from the logs/ folder.

Run each SPL query in the search bar.

Save visualizations as dashboard panels under Classic Dashboard.

Take screenshots and place them in the assets/ folder.

Update the README with screenshots and SPL queries.

üîπ Outcome
Multi-source threat detection is visualized clearly for potential attacks.

Dashboard demonstrates correlation between OS, firewall, and application logs.

All steps are reproducible in the Splunk Free Demo.

üîπ Optional Enhancements
Add a short video demo showing the live dashboard interaction.

Include additional logs for realistic traffic simulation.

Expand correlation to geo-location analysis for IPs.

This README is:

- **Clear for employers** ‚Äî shows what you built and how.  
- **Demo-compatible** ‚Äî no advanced Splunk Enterprise features.  
- **Visual & descriptive** ‚Äî includes screenshots, queries, and dashboard explanation.

If you want, I can **also make a polished version of your `assets/` folder structure and README links** ready to push so your GitHub repo looks fully professional.  

Do you want me to do that next?
